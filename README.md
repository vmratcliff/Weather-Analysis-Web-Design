# Web Design Challenge

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

Created a visualization dashboard website plotting weather data.

Create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page where a comparison of all of the plots can be viewed, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
